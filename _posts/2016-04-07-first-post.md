Since this is my first post, I guess I should give some sort of introduction to myself, so here goes...

I'm Paulin and I'm currently working as an R consultant for a company called Mango Solutions. It's great fun and I've been lucky enough to work on lots of interesting projects- for example, last week I was writing training materials for a training course on A/B testing (learning the material myself at the same time!) and this week I've been writing code to create plots of NONMEM data for a pharma company.

I think other people work on long term projects at work and then look for shorter projects on the side. Due to the nature of consultancy, I'm craving the opposite at the moment! Hence, this blog. :)

Last year I finished an Integrated Masters in Maths and Computer Science at the University of Oxford. I absolutely loved my time there, and I guess a large part starting this blog is to keep my mind sharp; to motivate me to keep thinking about hard and abstract problems! On this vein, I've just started learning Ruby by solving problems on HackerRank. I am loving the combinatorics problems but sometimes they do keep me up at night!

I'm also planning to start going to more meet ups so I'll be writing them up after here too. At the end of this month is Bath Camp meet up, titled "The Internet of Real Life" which I'm very much looking forward to. I've not been to a Bath:Hacked event yet even though I've been meaning to for ages. In addition, there's a few Bristol Hack nights, the Open Data Unconference.

To summarise, my interests are broad, ranging from discrete maths, programming languages, doing things with data... I'll blog about cool problems that I encounter, interesting meet ups that I go to and in general my thoughts on anything slightly technical. (What I deem to be "cool" and "interesting", at least.)
