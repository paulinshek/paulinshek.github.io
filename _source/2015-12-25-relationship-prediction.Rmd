Joe and I are both data fanatics, and we have been thinking of working on a project together for a long time. When we first started out, I used to always joke that we should do some analysis on other peoples relationships and use it to try and predict how long we'd last. Now we are over two years into our relationship, and we've finally deemed it stable enough to withhold the conclusions that we might find from the data! So here we go...

THE DATA:
We were able to get access to the following datasets:



```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
