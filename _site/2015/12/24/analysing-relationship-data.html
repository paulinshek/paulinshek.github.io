<p>Joe and I are both data fanatics, and we have been thinking of working
on a project together for a long time. When we first started out, I used
to always joke that we should do some analysis on other peoples
relationships and use it to try and predict how long we’d last. Now we
are over two years into our relationship, and we’ve finally deemed it
stable enough to withhold the conclusions that we might find from the
data! So here we go…</p>

<p>THE DATA: We were able to get access to the following datasets:</p>

<p>You can also embed plots, for example:</p>

<p>Note that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">echo = FALSE</code> parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.</p>
